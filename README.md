This Matlab project is concetrated aroung convex hull construction methods. The original set of points can have different distributions.
I used two methods: Grehem's and Kirkpatrick's methods together. Also there is a comparison with the standard Matlab function convexhull.
More detailed information is in REPORT.pdf (in Russian)
The way of distribution is given in WRITE2FILE.m
Start file is START_CONVEXHULL.m
